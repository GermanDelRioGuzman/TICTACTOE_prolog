# Tic-Tac-Toe with Prolog and Python

This repository contains a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using Python with a Tkinter GUI and Prolog for logic processing. The game showcases how to integrate Python with Prolog using the PySwip library, providing an example of using logic programming within a graphical Python application.

## Features

- Graphical user interface using Tkinter.
- Game logic implemented in Prolog.
- Dynamic interaction between Python and Prolog using PySwip.
- Visual indication for player turns and game outcomes.

## Prerequisites

Before you run this project, you need to have Python and SWI-Prolog installed on your machine. Additionally, you need the PySwip library which facilitates the integration between Python and Prolog.

- Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- SWI-Prolog (https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html)
- PySwip: Install it using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install pyswip
